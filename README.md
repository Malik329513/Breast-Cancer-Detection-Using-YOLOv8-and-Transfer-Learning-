# Description
This project explores deep learning techniques for breast cancer detection in mammograms, focusing on CNN models and YOLOv8. Utilizing architectures like VGG16, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0, the study analyzes their performance in detecting cancer from DICOM images. Data from the CBIS-DDSM dataset underwent preprocessing, including resizing, augmentation, and normalization, to enhance model training. The research evaluates both classification and object detection approaches. Ultimately, the work aims to improve early breast cancer detection using advanced deep learning methods.
